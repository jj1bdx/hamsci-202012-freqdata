After the December Eclipse 2020 Festival, I've been measuring the reception
frequency offset of Airspy HF+ Discovery for the measurement set to 9999kHz
USB with Leo Bodnar Mini GPSDO set to 10MHz.  The detailed measurement for 12
hours suggested that the 10MHz is mapped to 998.8689Hz. This means the Airspy
HF+ Discovery is actually set to 9999kHz + 1.1311 Hz higher in the reception
carrier frequency.
